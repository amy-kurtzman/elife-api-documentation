# Object model 

One of the powerful things about Fluidinfo is that _other_ people can start adding their own information onto objects that we create about eLife articles. We are in effect allowing you to tag, annotate or make comments at a very granular level on information about eLife authors and papers. We will also be _decorating_ eLife articles with article level metrics, from a variety of sources, but if you have other data that you want to add, you can do that too. 

In the image below you can see a visual representation of an object that we have created in Fluidinfo. This represents the data that we have populated about the article with the DOI dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00242. We are using the DOI of an article as the Fluidinfo _about_ tag, as it is the best unique primary descriptor of objects that we are creating. 

You can see that we have added information onto the object as essentially key-value pairs. The beautiful thing about this approach is that you can go [sign up][fia] for a Fluidinfo key, and start adding your own metadata too. We hope to start aggregating useful information that appears this way, and exposing it on the original article pages, and to the authors.
