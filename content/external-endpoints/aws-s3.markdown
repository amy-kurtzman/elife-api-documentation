# AWS buckets

eLife content is also hosted at the following AWS bucket. If you have an [aws developer key][awsk] then you can access the content directly. The bucket has been set up so that people who access the data pay for the transfer costs, so your AWS account will be billed for any data transfers that you do against this bucket.
